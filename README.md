## The role of analytics in a company
Analytics is one of the functions of a business.


__For whom analysts work in the company:__
- shareholders
- employees
- customers


__The tasks that analytics solves:__
- For shareholders: increasing profits and reducing costs
- For employees: compliance, risk avoidance, researching new products and services
- For customers: to receive high quality service or products



__They all need information to make decisions!__

The goal of Analytics is simple: to help businesses extract valuable insights from data. To do this, we need to create an analytics solution where users can work with data on their own, test their hypotheses, and analyze business problems using the right metrics.
